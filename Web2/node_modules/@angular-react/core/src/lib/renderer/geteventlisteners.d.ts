/**
 * Monkey-patches `Element`'s `addEventListener` & `removeEventListener` and adds `getEventListeners`.
 * This later allows the renderer to emit any event handlers attached to React-wrapped components as Angular Outputs:
 * ```html
 * <my-component (arbitraryEvent)="onEventHandler($event)"></my-component>
 * ```
 *
 * @note Taken and modified from https://github.com/colxi/getEventListeners to be compiled into ES5, allowing running in older browsers
